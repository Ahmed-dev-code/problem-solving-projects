# Problem-Solving Projects

A collection of projects focused on applying advanced algorithms to tackle NP-hard problems and implement AI agents for games. These projects showcase the use of search algorithms, optimization techniques, and game AI to create interactive and intelligent applications.

## Projects

### 1. [Knight's Tour Problem](https://github.com/Ahmed-dev-code/knights-tour-GA)
- **Description**: A Python program that solves the classic Knight's Tour problem, where a knight must visit every square on a chessboard exactly once.
- **Approach**: The program employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to find possible solutions, visualizing the knight's path on a chessboard.
- **Features**:
  - Visual representation of the knight's path.
  - Solution outputs.

### 2. [Rush Hour Puzzle](https://github.com/Ahmed-dev-code/RushHourPuzzle) (private can be accessed on demand)
- **Description**: An implementation of the Rush Hour puzzle, where the goal is to move vehicles to get the red car out of the gridlock.
- **Approach**: This project uses the A* search algorithm to find optimal solutions and features an interface built with Pygame.
- **Features**:
  - customize the puzzle
  - Step-by-step solution visualization.

### 3. [Connect Four Game](https://github.com/mehdidhammou/connect-four)
- **Description**: A Connect Four game where a human player competes against an AI opponent.
- **Approach**: The AI opponent is implemented using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to optimize decision-making.
- **Features**:
  - Two-player mode (human vs. AI).
  - Visual display of the game board.
